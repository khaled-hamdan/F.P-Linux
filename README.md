<h1>Update file permissions in Linux</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
 The research team at my organization needs to update the file permissions for certain files and directories within the projects directory.
 The permissions do not currently reflect the level of authorization that should be given. Checking and updating these permissions will help keep
their system secure.
I changed multiple permissions to match the level of authorization my organization wanted for files and directories in the projects directory. The first step in this was using ls -la to check the permissions for the directory. This informed my decisions in the following steps. I then used the chmod command multiple times to change the permissions on files and directories.
